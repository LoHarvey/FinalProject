# The Midnight Syndicate
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2025

## Theme
We thought about implementing the theme in several ways—-one chance, one life, one choice-—and how each could play out in something like a murder mystery, a matchmaking game, a visual novel, etc. We ultimately settled on the “one choice,” idea, making it possible for players to choose only one option at the start of our game (a weapon), which would influence the way the rest of the story plays out. 

## Game Play
Objective: Join a rogue syndicate on the night of the Moon Festival in this short narrative game. Your mission: rob the royal palace. Choose your weapon wisely--it may decide the fate of your crew.

Game-play instructions: Navigate the story using the space bar to advance text and your mouse to make critical choices.

## Impediments
The hardest part about creating our game was coordinating times to meet as a group, since we each were a bit scattered in terms of locations/work/other priorities. We had to communicate over text quite a bit, which definitely complicated things because of delays and ideas that might’ve been lost in translation. We also encountered a bit of trouble implementing our sprites and fonts and the like, but we eventually got it all figured out.

## Implementation
- Includes a visual novel look and feel with point and click dialogue/choice options
- Takes on a medieval look and feel
- Almost all assets created by our team, save the fonts:
    - Characters + sounds by Ash
    - Weapons + backgrounds by Izzy
